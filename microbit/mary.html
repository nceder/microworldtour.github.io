                  <p>Mary was out for another social evening 10th
		  December as she made an appearance at the regular <a
		  href="http://www.chipy.org/" >ChiPy
		  meeting</a>. With over 60 people in attendance Mary
		  apparently got a bit of stage fright and lost her
		  interactive REPL voice. While this hardware problem
		  made the presentation a bit more challenging, it is
		  still possible for her to run flashed scripts, and
		  as they say, "the show must go on!"</p>
		  <p>Naomi gave a talk about the background leading up
		  to the micro:bit, including the BBC Micro, and
		  explained some of the goals of the project and how
		  Python made it onto the micro:bit.</p>
		  <p>In spite of losing her voice, Mary did manage to
		   <a href="https://t.co/Te7x1U9WtT"> say hello to the
		  ChiPy members</a>.

                    <p>It might have taken Mary a while to make it to
		  Chicago, but she's quickly making friends!</p>
		  <p>Our first stop was a "sneak preview" evening with
		  several interested local Pythonistas. Naomi walked
		  through some of the background leading to the
		  micro:bit and having Python on it.</p>
		  <img src="/photo/Mary_with_hand.JPG" alt="Mary">
		  <p>Then, we ended with some demos and
		  experimentation. Chicago ChiPy member Tanya
		  Schlusser had brought a toy truck (a "Monster Road
		  Ripper"!) which Tanya had modified to allow control
		  from a micro:bit.</p>
                  <img src="/photo/attendees1.JPG"  alt="Chicago sneak
		  preview">
		  <p>Tanya's notes on how she took a $6.99 toy
		  and made it micro:bit-able <a href="/photo/wiring_the_road_ripper.pdf" >are here</a>. In the end it
		  was a success, since Mary managed to drive the truck
		  and even stop short of crashing!
		  </p>
		  <p>Finally we played around quite a bit with the
		  music library, even finding something that we all thought
		  needed to be "fixed". Stay tuned for a later post on
		  that.</p>
		  <p>Mary will be out for another social evening 10th
		  December as she presents at the regular <a
		  href="http://www.chipy.org/" >ChiPy
		  meeting</a>. We'll report on this in a later post.</p>
