					<p>After many days of fruitless work I have not succeeded in creating the neopixel library.
					I was using the neopixel branch in the <a href="https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython">bbcmicrobit repository</a>
					But my C language skills are not up to it.</p>
					<p>I have sent the Microbit onto Nick Coghan in Australia for the next step in Mohandas's journey.</p>

					<p>The fire simulation is working pretty well but a diffuser would soften the pinpoints and make it look much better.
					The simplest way is to put a piece of paper on top of the LEDs. It needs some separation between the LEDs and the paper
					to soften the glow. So I decided to do it the hard way and quickly write something in OpenSCAD and print
					it out on a 3D printer. The 3D file is hosted on thingiverse here: 
					<a href="https://github.com/Neon22/Microbit-code">Microbit Diffuser</a></p>
					<p><img class="figure" src="http://i67.tinypic.com/2v3r38m.jpg"></p>
					<p>The program uses the two buttons to control the delay between frames and the amount of interpolation that occurs
					between new lines of fire being added. The program works in the following way:</p>
					<p>It starts by making a line of brightness points on the bottom row of the display. 
					Each time it generates a new line, it moves the previous one up. But this is not what makes it look like fire.</p>
					<p>To do this we do interpolation frames between the major "new line of fire" frames. The interpolation looks
					at a line and its preceeding one and performs an interpolation to calculate an intermediate frame.
					This is done several times before a new line of fire points is added to the bottom row.</p>
					<p>We also multiply the resulting pixel values by a mask. This mask tapers off the values
					and gives us a kind of shape to the grid instead of a square block.</p>
					<p>Here's a video of the fire in action, both without and with the 3D diffuser.</p>

                    <p>Finally got everything sorted out, building, checkouts, talking to the Microbit. All set to go.
					Thought I'd start with a little program to simulate fire on the display. I'm using the 
					mechanism where you type in a command and it transfers the program to the Microbit, runs it
                    and reports any messages (errors, print(), etc) directly back to you. Good for debugging. Looks like this:
                    <pre class="prettyprint">micropython/tools/pyboard.py /dev/ttyACM0 your_code.py</pre>Where the "pyboard.py" program is from the cloned 
					<a href="https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython">repository</a>, "your_code.py" is your
					program, and "ttyACM0" is the USB port for communicating with the Microbit.</p>
					<p>So I started a fire simulation program. Needed to choose between making and updating
					an Image, and then telling the display to show it, or setting pixel values directly in the display.
					In the end I went with <pre class="prettyprint">display.set_pixel(x, y, value)</pre> to make the code small.
					There's nota lot of room on the Microbit and all the comments are  included in the memory footprint of the code.
					This means I need to try to keep the programs small.</p>
					<p>The code for this is on the <a href="https://github.com/Neon22/Microbit-code">github repo here</a>
					</p>
					<p>The fire simulation is working pretty well but a diffuser would soften the pinpoints and make it look much better.
					I'll try for one tomorrow. Here we can see the code that generates a new line of fire points <pre class="prettyprint">
# Generate a new bottom row of random values for the flames
def generate_line(line, start=min_brightness, end=max_brightness):
    "start and end define range of dimmest to brightest 'flames'"
    for i in range(display_width):
        line[i] = start + microbit.random(end-start)</pre>The function takes in an array of 5 values, called line, and
		puts 5 new random values into it. The range of the values represents the brightness of the flames.</p>

                    <p>Spent the day setting up my Ubuntu14.04LTS machine and getting git and the other tools
                    on. Because I'm developing a new library, I have more to do than the usual user.</p>
                    <p>Needed to work out how to build from the repo using Yotta, as well as download and
                    connect using a serial terminal program. I ended up using <a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gtkterm/"> gtkterm</a> which is pretty useful
                    on Linux. Making lots of notes to pass back to Nicholas for the next person.</p>
					<p>Typing: <pre class="prettyprint">dmesg | grep tty</pre> at a linux command line prompt tells you which
					serial port the Microbit connected as, when you plugged it in.</p>
